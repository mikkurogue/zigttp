# Zigttp

A small HTTP Server that I'm building that I can use for static file serving that I can dump onto a VPS and serve my own static HTML files.

Essentially, this is a worse version of XAMPP or LAMPP or nginx, but written in Zig by me (a total idiot).

## Current feature set:

Open a connection and open an index.html file from the `cwd/www/` directory and send that as a response for the `/` route.

### Contributing

Because I am not exactly well versed in Zig as of yet, I wouldn't mind having help or pointers on how to proceed. I have no templates to contributing just having some fun while we write code in a cool language!
